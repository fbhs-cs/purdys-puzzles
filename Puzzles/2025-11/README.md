The Fibonacci numbers are a famous sequence of numbers which starts off
with 1, 1, then each subsequent number in the sequence is generated by
adding together the two preceeding numbers:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

The first 6 Fibonacci numbers are 1 digit numbers, so each of
their digits add up to a Fibonacci number.

13's digits add up to 4 (1 + 3 = 4), which is not a Fibonacci number.
21's digits add up to 3 (2 + 1 = 3), which is a Fibonacci number.

The next Fibonacci number whose digits add up to a Fibonacci number is 233.
The next after that is 317811.  

Of the first **2025** Fibonacci numbers, what is the sum of the digits of all
of the Fibonacci numbers whose digits sum to a Fibonacci number?
